# 💫 About Me:
🚀 Passionate Software Engineer | Innovator | Problem Solver

Welcome to my Github profile! Currently, I am making impactful contributions as a Software Engineer at Avalara. I am a dedicated and results-driven professional with a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science & Engineering from Kalinga Institute Of Industrial Technology (May 2023).

🛠️ Professional Journey At Avalara, I am part of the Identity and Access Management (IAM) team, developing a custom IAM system using cutting-edge technologies like Microservices, MongoDB, AWS, OAuth, OpenID Connect, and the Avalara Identity Provider. My work focuses on building secure, scalable solutions for account-level object security and user access control.

Prior to Avalara, I worked at Informatica as a Backend Developer for API Manager, a cloud-based service. I optimized log retrieval processes using Kafka, reducing analytics latency by 40% and saving $60K annually. Additionally, I improved code reliability by enhancing code coverage by 80% through JUnit test cases and resolved high-priority bugs critical for product growth.

🌐 Previous Experience My journey began as a Prism Student Trainee at Samsung R&D, where I developed an engine to separate speech and non-speech parts from audio, which led to a published paper at the 2022 IEEE Delhi Section Conference.

🚀 Projects & Hackathons I love taking on challenges! I've showcased my skills in various projects, including addressing security concerns in APIs at HACK{AI}THON, developing a WebSocket Chat Application, and creating a Chrome extension for real-time contest updates.

🛠️ Skills Snapshot My technical toolkit includes proficiency in Java, C++, Python, ASP.NET, HTML/CSS3, JavaScript, and more. I am well-versed in databases like MongoDB, Firebase, and MySQL, with hands-on experience in frameworks such as Spring Boot, Apache Kafka, and Hibernate. I also utilize AWS, Azure, and GCP for cloud-based solutions.

🏆 Achievements I thrive on challenges and have solved over 700 problems on Leetcode, consistently ranking in the top percentiles worldwide. I've excelled in coding competitions, including Google Hash Code 2022 and Meta HackerCup 2023, and secured the top position in the CodeStudio Weekend Contest 21 organized by Coding Ninjas.

🌐 Beyond Coding Beyond coding, I've embraced opportunities like the Summer Of Bitcoin code challenge and was selected as a Research Intern at the University of British Columbia through Mitacs.
